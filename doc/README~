BACKGROUND

This work is intended to revive a project by Quang Do that performs
comparison of relations and identifies whether two relations are
related, i.e. whether one relation entails the other.

The project has been alternately called Jupiter, RelationIdentifier,
and TAREC (an acronym for Taxonomic Relation Classifier). 

The initial goal is to resurrect a live web demo (which historically
did not use the full machine learning apparatus described in the
paper (see http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/publication_view/690)
in the interest of speed.

The project as was had some problems: 
-- dependencies on large indexes and other resources
-- hard-coded paths to some files, particularly in the learned LBJ  
   classifier
-- lack of detailed documentation describing how to run the software
   to build indexes and train a classifier
-- use of outdated project structure, with outdated dependency on LBJ
   (now LBJava)





TODO

 FIXME: EntityCategorization.java
   originally, this said 'plural = nounGroup.plural()'
   but this method does not appear to exist in the yago code.



* Create documentation. 
** identify and describe dependencies, e.g. Descartes resources,
   wikipedia dumps, etc.
** explain process to compile Jupiter.jar
** explain process to build indexes programmatically
** explain process to train classifier

* fix the build process
** currently it wants to log into a server. Why? -- this really shouldn't be needed.
** it needs to compile stuff like 
  /src/edu/illinois/cs/cogcomp/cikm09/learning/Instance.java
  and put it on the classpath before the lbj compilation step. 
* organize dependency resources
** specify a canonical way to store the dependencies locally
** write scripts to run the Jupiter commands 

* update LBJ dependency to LBJava

* reorganize project as a Maven project, using standard Maven
  directory structure

* restore the web demo


WHERE TO FIND EXISTING RESOURCES (ESP. INDEX FILES)

/shared/trollope/ccg-demos/relation-identifier/
/shared/austen/group-software/TAREC
/shared/saruman/quangdo2/Descartes/


PREREQUISITES

you need Ant optional dependency jsch.jar (http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsch/files/latest/download)

-- copy it into ~/.ant/lib/

You will need some resource files built using Descartes, a different 
project. Specifically, the conf/config.xml file refers to 

Descartes/data/WNSimWUP/index.nounverb.score.filtered088
Descartes/data/WNSimWUP/index.nounverb.uniqued




CONFIGURATION

To install and/or build indexes used by the relation identifier, you will
need to change some parameters in configuration files: specifically,
you must set the paths to various indexes to the appropriate values.
This may require you to build the relevant indexes etc. first, using
the appropriate commands/software.

Sources of existing indexes are listed above.




INSTALLATION

>   ant -f make-jar.xml
