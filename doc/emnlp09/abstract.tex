We present a novel approach to identifying relations between a pair of
concepts. We focus on identifying relations that are essential to
support textual inference: determining whether two concepts have an
ancestor relation, a sibling relation, or no relation. We develop a
machine learning-based approach that makes use of Wikipedia as a main
source for background knowledge, but we also propose an effective
approach of searching the Web to improve the coverage of our method
and support inference between concepts not present in Wikipedia. Our
key innovation is that, in order to accurately determine the relations
between concepts $C_1$ and $C_2$, we consider an automatically
generated collection of related concepts, evaluate all pairwise
relations, and use constraint-based inference to force them to cohere,
thus improving the local prediction of the pairwise relation
identification. We demonstrate that the inference technique
significantly enhances the local prediction methods and consequently
exhibit very large improvements over methods using existing knowledge
sources.
